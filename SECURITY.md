## security best practices

When deploying orla:

- Keep orla updated to the latest version.
- Run orla behind an authenticating reverse proxy such as nginx, Cloudflare, or a service mesh. Orla itself does not enforce authentication on its API.
- Use Postgres credentials with the minimum privileges orla requires. Read and write on its own database is enough, and no superuser is needed.
- Protect the upstream LLM and tool API keys orla holds in environment variables. Restrict who can read the process environment, and avoid committing `.env` files.
- Monitor `/metrics` and structured logs for anomalous request patterns.

## known security considerations

1. **No built-in auth.** The HTTP API trusts every caller. A reverse proxy or service mesh must enforce identity.
2. **API key fan-out.** Orla holds outbound credentials for every backend. Compromise of the orla process exposes all of them.
3. **Rate limiting is per-instance.** `rate_per_second` is enforced per orla process. Multiple replicas multiply the effective cap.
4. **Tenant isolation is advisory.** Tenancy is carried by request headers such as `X-Orla-Tag-Tenant` and used for fair-share scheduling. It is not a security boundary on its own.

Thank you for helping keep orla secure!
